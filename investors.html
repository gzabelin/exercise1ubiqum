            <h2>What if Obi Wan fought 1000 Anakins but was on top of Mount Everest?</h2>

            <p> Well, Mount Everest is approximately 29,000 feet tall. With 1,000 Anakins in play, Obi-Wan has 29 feet of high ground per Anakin. In Episode III, we saw Obi-Wan defeat Anakin using the high ground. If Obi-Wan had less than 29 feet of high ground when he defeated Anakin then, we can safely conclude that he could beat 1,000 Anakins with a high-ground advantage of 29,000 feet. Judging by footage from Episode III, Obi-Wan appears to be standing approximately two and a half of his own body lengths above the level of the lava. Since Ewan McGregor is 5 feet, 9.5 inches tall, he is approximately 14 feet, 5.75 inches above the level of the lava. Taking into account the fact that Anakin was actually jumping from a little bit above the level of the lava, the fact that Obi-Wan may have been able defeat Anakin from an even lower ground, and the fact that I purposely erred on the side of overestimating Obi-Wan’s elevation, it seems clear that a 29 foot advantage is more than twice what Obi-Wan needs to defeat a single Anakin. Thus, I conclude that Obi-Wan would definitely be able to defeat 1,000 Anakins if he was standing atop Mount Everest. In fact, he would probably even defeat 2,000 Anakins. In conclusion, don’t try it</p>
